## Chapter 1

### Wisdom 1

> The poet in winter seclusion revels in the beauty of a sudden snowstorm. He does not use the snow and the unpredictability of the weather to pontificate on the evergreen meadows of heaven. (Manu Bazzano, *Zen Poems* [London: MQ Publications, 2002], 16)

### Wisdom 2

> By renouncing luxury, we may detect the pleasures of the plain and simple and circumvent the tyranny of choice. (Rolf Reber, *Critical Feeling: How to Use Feelings Strategically* [Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2016], 109)

### Wisdom 3

> However clever a design or vaunted a purpose, quintessence can no more be stalked and captured than can true love. (Betty Cornfield and Owen Edwards, *Quintessence: The Quality of Having It* [New York: Black Dog & Leventhal Publishers, 1983], 9)
